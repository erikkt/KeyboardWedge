# Bluetooth KeyboardWedge
Arduino sketch for an ESP32 (ESP-WROOM-32) and an RC522 RFID reader

This is a fork from https://github.com/zwack-am/KeyboardWedge
It is ported to the ESP32 platform to support bluetooth. Some features have also been added, like serial debugging and the ability to change the "terminator" character. 

-------------------



This Sketch allows you to "type" a password by reading a suitably formatted token on the reader.
